### Connect4 is a Connect 4 game created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make it playable on the website with a tutorial. It's not quite finished yet as we haven't added music and sound effect yet, but the game is playable and works the way we want it to.

### rmt stands for "Remind Me There", it's a mobile application that uses GPS and notifications to alert users in their daily life. Our application has 2 modes that send notifications to users. The first mode is set to TIME and works like an alarm clock, reminding users what they should do at the marked time. The second mode is the LOCATION mode. It uses GPS and allows users to mark the desired location, e.g. a store. When the users approach the marked location, a notification is sent to the users so that they don't forget what to do at the marked location.
